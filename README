GEA - an abstraction layer for developing network protocols

The GEA libray provides an abstraction layer for network protocols.
Functions , e.g. like sending packets, are provided and mapped to the
underlying system. This is by default the POSIX-API. But other
platforms can also provide an implementation. Currently such an
implementation exists for the ns-2. This allow protocols developed
with GEA to run on native POSIX platforms (like Linux or Unix). But
the same implementation can be used in the ns-2 network simulator. By
this the protocol implementation can be tested in large simulated
networks.
