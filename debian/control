Description: GEA - an abstraction layer for developing network protocols
 The GEA libray provides an abstraction layer for network protocols.
 Functions , e.g. like sending packets, are provided and mapped to the
 underlying system. This is by default the POSIX-API. But other
 platforms can also provide an implementation. Currently such an
 implementation exists for the ns-2. This allow protocols developed
 with GEA to run on native POSIX platforms (like Linux or Unix). But
 the same implementation can be used in the ns-2 network simulator. By
 this the protocol implementation can be tested in large simulated
 networks.
